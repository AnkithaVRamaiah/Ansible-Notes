# **Error Handling and Order of Execution in Ansible**

#### **Order of Execution in Ansible Playbooks**
When an Ansible playbook is executed, its tasks are executed sequentially on all managed nodes. Here's the key behavior:

1. **Task Execution Across Nodes**: 
   - Task 1 is executed on **all nodes**.
   - Only when Task 1 is **successful on all nodes**, does Ansible proceed to Task 2. This is the **default nature** of Ansible.

2. **Impact on Configuration Management**:
   - This behavior can be problematic in some scenarios, such as during configuration management.
   - For example, consider a playbook designed to install Docker on managed nodes with these steps:
     1. Verify if SSH is available on the node.
     2. Check the version of Docker (if already installed).
     3. Install Docker if not installed.

   - If one of the managed nodes does **not have SSH** enabled, the playbook execution will stop for that node. The installation process will fail for that node, while other nodes may still continue execution. This can cause partial failures.

#### **Error Handling in Ansible**
To handle errors and allow the playbook to continue executing on other nodes despite failures, you can use **error-handling mechanisms**.

1. **Using `ignore_errors: yes`**:
   - This directive tells Ansible to **ignore errors** for a specific task. Even if the task fails, Ansible will move on to the next task.

   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     ---
     - hosts: all
       become: true

       tasks:
         - name: Install security updates
           ansible.builtin.apt:
             name: "{{ item }}"
             state: latest
           loop:
             - openssl
             - openssh
           ignore_errors: yes

         - name: Check if Docker is installed
           ansible.builtin.command: docker --version
           register: output
           ignore_errors: yes

         - name: Debug Docker version output
           ansible.builtin.debug:
             var: output

         - name: Install Docker
           ansible.builtin.apt:
             name: docker.io
             state: present
           when: output.failed
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - **`ignore_errors: yes`** is used to allow the playbook to proceed even if one of the tasks fails (e.g., SSH is not available on a node).
     - The `register` variable stores the task output, and `when` is used to conditionally execute tasks based on the output (e.g., install Docker only if the Docker check fails).

---

2. **Defining Failure with `failed_when`**:
   - In some cases, you may want to explicitly define conditions under which a task is considered a **failure** or **success**.
   - The `failed_when` directive is used for this purpose. It overrides the default behavior of Ansible's failure detection.

   - **Syntax**:
     ```yaml
     failed_when:
       - "CONDITION"
     ```

   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     - name: Check available disk space
       ansible.builtin.shell: df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g'
       register: disk_usage

     - name: Ensure disk usage is less than 80%
       ansible.builtin.debug:
         msg: "Disk usage is acceptable: {{ disk_usage.stdout }}%"
       failed_when:
         - disk_usage.stdout | int > 80
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - The task checks the disk usage on a node.
     - If the disk usage exceeds 80%, the task is marked as failed due to the condition specified in `failed_when`.

---

#### **Key Points to Remember**
1. **Default Execution**: Tasks execute sequentially, and the next task runs only when the current task succeeds for all nodes.
2. **Handling Failures**:
   - Use `ignore_errors: yes` to allow playbook execution to continue even if a task fails.
   - Use `failed_when` to explicitly define custom failure conditions.
3. **Conditional Execution**:
   - Use `when` to control task execution based on the results of previous tasks (e.g., only install Docker if it's not installed).

With these mechanisms, you can make your Ansible playbooks more robust and better suited for complex scenarios, ensuring smoother configuration management across managed nodes.
