
### **Order of Execution in Ansible Playbooks**

Ansible executes tasks sequentially, which means one task must complete successfully on all nodes before moving to the next one. While this helps maintain consistency, it can lead to issues in certain scenarios. Here's a simple breakdown:

---

### 1. **Task Execution Across Nodes**

- **Simultaneous Execution**: Ansible runs each task on all managed nodes at the same time.
- **Sequential Progress**: Ansible only moves to the next task once **every node** has successfully completed the current task.
- **Failure Behavior**: If one node fails a task, the playbook won’t proceed with that node but will continue on the other nodes where the task succeeded.

#### **Example**:
- You want to install software across multiple nodes. If one node fails (e.g., due to missing dependencies), the task stops for that node, but the other nodes that passed the task will continue executing.

---

### 2. **Impact on Configuration Management**

This sequential execution can cause problems, especially in **configuration management** scenarios:

- **Incomplete Configurations**: If a task is crucial for subsequent tasks (e.g., installing a package before configuring a service), a failure on one node can prevent further configuration on that node.
- **Example**: Suppose your playbook does the following:
  1. Check if SSH is available.
  2. Verify if Docker is installed.
  3. Install Docker if it's not installed.

  If **one node doesn't have SSH enabled**, the first task fails for that node, and the playbook halts for that node. The other nodes continue, but now that problematic node won't have Docker installed.

---

### 3. **How to Handle Failures**

Ansible provides a few ways to handle failures:

- **Retry Mechanism**: You can use `retries` and `delay` to try tasks again after they fail. This is helpful for intermittent issues.
- **Failure Strategies**:
  - **`ignore_errors: yes`**: If you want the playbook to continue despite a task failing on some nodes, you can use this directive. But use it with caution, as it might hide real issues.
  
    **Example with `ignore_errors`**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Check if SSH is available
      command: ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 user@{{ inventory_hostname }} echo ok
      ignore_errors: yes
    ```

  - **`any_errors_fatal: true`**: This will stop the entire playbook if any node fails. It’s useful when you want the playbook to halt execution immediately upon any failure.

---

### 4. **Considerations for Configuration Management**

- **Task Dependencies**: If your playbook’s tasks depend on each other (like installing a service and configuring it), a failure in an early task can cause issues in later tasks.
- **Idempotency**: Ansible is designed to be **idempotent**, meaning that running the same playbook multiple times won't cause unintended side effects. However, failures in task order can break this behavior, especially when making system changes like installing or removing packages.

---

### **Conclusion**

Ansible executes tasks sequentially across all nodes, meaning every task must succeed on all nodes before moving to the next. While this ensures consistency, it can result in **partial failures** if one node encounters an issue. It’s important to design your playbooks with error handling in mind to avoid these issues and maintain smooth execution across your infrastructure.

### **Error Handling in Ansible**

Ansible allows you to continue executing tasks even if one task fails. This is important because in real-life scenarios, not all tasks will always succeed (e.g., a node might not be reachable, or a service might be temporarily down). By using **error handling**, you can ensure that the playbook doesn't stop entirely and can proceed with the next tasks.

There are two common ways to handle errors in Ansible:

---

### 1. **Using `ignore_errors: yes`**

This is the simplest way to ignore any errors in a task. If a task fails, Ansible will **not stop the entire playbook** but will **move on to the next task**.

#### Example:
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Install security updates
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: latest
      loop:
        - openssl
        - openssh
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Check if Docker is installed
      ansible.builtin.command: docker --version
      register: output
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Debug Docker version output
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: output

    - name: Install Docker
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present
      when: output.failed
```

#### What happens here:
- The first task installs security updates. If it fails (e.g., if a package is already installed or there's a network issue), Ansible **does not stop** and moves to the next task because of `ignore_errors: yes`.
- The second task checks if Docker is installed. If this check fails, Ansible still moves on.
- The **`when: output.failed`** part ensures that Docker gets installed **only if the check failed** (i.e., if Docker isn't installed).

**Why use `ignore_errors: yes`?**
- Use this when you expect that some tasks may fail but you don’t want them to stop the entire playbook. For example, if you're trying to install packages and one of them fails, you may want to skip the error and proceed with other tasks.

### 2. **Using `failed_when` for Custom Failures**

Sometimes, you may want to define your own conditions to determine when a task should be considered as failed, rather than relying on Ansible's default failure detection (like a non-zero exit code). This is where the `failed_when` directive comes in.

#### Example:
```yaml
- name: Check available disk space
  ansible.builtin.shell: df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g'
  register: disk_usage

- name: Ensure disk usage is less than 80%
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "Disk usage is acceptable: {{ disk_usage.stdout }}%"
  failed_when:
    - disk_usage.stdout | int > 80
```

#### What happens here:
- The first task checks disk space on the server. It stores the result in `disk_usage`.
- The second task uses `failed_when` to check if the disk space is over 80%. If the disk usage exceeds 80%, **the task will be marked as failed**.
- This is useful because you are creating a **custom condition**. Ansible will only mark the task as failed if the disk usage is greater than 80%, even if the command ran successfully (exit code 0).

**Why use `failed_when`?**
- Use this when you need more control over what counts as a "failure" for a task. For example, you may want to fail a task if the disk space exceeds a certain threshold, even if the command itself ran without any issues.

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **Normal Behavior**: Normally, Ansible stops running tasks if one fails. If you don’t do anything special, any failure will stop the execution of the entire playbook.

2. **Using `ignore_errors: yes`**: 
   - This is like telling Ansible: "If this task fails, don’t stop the playbook, just continue with the next task."
   - For example, you might ignore an error if a service isn’t running on a node, but it doesn’t stop you from continuing the next task.

3. **Using `failed_when`**:
   - This allows you to **define your own failure conditions**.
   - For example, if you're checking disk usage, you might want to fail the task only if the usage exceeds 80%, even if the command ran fine.

4. **Use `when` for Conditional Execution**: You can also use `when` to make tasks conditional. For example, only install Docker if it isn't already installed, by checking a condition from the previous task.

---

### Final Thoughts:

By using `ignore_errors` and `failed_when`, you can make your Ansible playbooks more **flexible** and **resilient**, allowing them to continue executing even when some tasks fail, and making decisions based on your own failure conditions. This is especially useful in real-world environments where failures might be expected or transient, and you don’t want to stop everything just because one task failed.
