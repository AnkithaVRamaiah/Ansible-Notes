# **Ansible Role**

#### **Why do we use roles in Ansible?**
- When a playbook contains **numerous tasks**, it becomes:
  - Difficult to read and maintain.
  - Unmanageable as the playbook grows in size, similar to a **monolithic application** where everything is bundled into a single file.
- To overcome this challenge, we use **roles**, which allow us to structure and organize Ansible code into smaller, reusable components. Roles break down a large playbook into manageable parts.

- When you write a large playbook, it’s like having one big file with everything inside it, which can get messy. Roles help by splitting up the playbook into smaller, more manageable pieces. It’s like dividing a huge project into tasks, making everything easier to understand and maintain.

#### **What is an Ansible Role?**
- A **role** in Ansible is a way to group tasks, variables, handlers, files, and templates logically, enabling reusability and better organization.
- When you create a role, it generates a standard folder structure that helps manage different parts of the automation code separately.

#### **Default Role Folder Structure**
When you create a role, it generates the following directories by default:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy role init <role-name>
```
This command creates a folder named `<role-name>` with the following subdirectories:
  
1. **`tasks/`**  
   - This folder contains the **main tasks** to be executed.
   - Example: Installing packages, configuring services, or setting permissions.

2. **`vars/`**  
   - Stores variables that can be used within the role.
   - Variables in this folder have a **higher priority** than those in the `defaults/` folder.

3. **`defaults/`**  
   - Contains the **default values** for variables.  
   - These variables are overridden if custom values are provided in other places (e.g., playbooks, inventory files).

4. **`handlers/`**  
   - Contains tasks that are triggered only when a specific **notification** is sent by another task.
   - Example: Restarting a service after a configuration file is updated.

5. **`templates/`**  
   - Holds **Jinja2 template files**.
   - Templates are used to create or modify files dynamically based on variables (e.g., configuration files where specific values may vary).

6. **`files/`**  
   - Contains **static files** (e.g., binaries, prebuilt configuration files) that are copied directly to the target machine without modification.

7. **`meta/`**  
   - Contains metadata about the role, such as:
     - Role dependencies (other roles it relies on).
     - Author information.
     - Minimum Ansible version required.

8. **`tests/`**  
   - Contains test playbooks and inventory files for testing the role.
   - Helps in validating that the role works as intended.

#### **Why is this folder structure useful?**
1. **Modularity**: Tasks, variables, and other components are grouped logically, making it easy to locate and modify them.
2. **Reusability**: Roles can be shared across multiple playbooks or projects.
3. **Readability**: The separation of concerns ensures that each part of the role focuses on a specific purpose.

#### **Example of Key Directories and Their Uses**
- **Tasks (`tasks/main.yml`)**:  
  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Install Apache
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
  ```

- **Variables (`vars/main.yml`)**:  
  ```yaml
  ---
  apache_version: 2.4
  ```

- **Templates (`templates/httpd.conf.j2`)**:  
  ```nginx
  Listen {{ apache_port }}
  ServerAdmin {{ admin_email }}
  ```

- **Handlers (`handlers/main.yml`)**:  
  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Restart Apache
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
  ```

- **Defaults (`defaults/main.yml`)**:  
  ```yaml
  ---
  apache_port: 80
  admin_email: admin@example.com
  ```

#### **How to Use a Role in a Playbook**
Once the role is created and defined, it can be referenced in a playbook as follows:
```yaml
- hosts: web_servers
  roles:
    - role: <role-name>
```

By organizing your playbooks using roles, you achieve cleaner code, easier debugging, and better collaboration.
