# **Vault in Ansible**

When working with sensitive information, such as AWS access keys (access key ID and secret access key), it's critical to avoid hardcoding these values directly in your playbooks. Hardcoding sensitive data in playbooks poses a significant security risk because it can be easily accessed or misused by unauthorized users.

To securely handle this sensitive information, **Ansible Vault** is used. Ansible Vault enables you to encrypt sensitive data (such as passwords, API tokens, and AWS credentials) and store it in a secure manner. With Ansible Vault, you can encrypt secrets, safely reference them in your playbooks, and only decrypt them when necessary.

### **Why Use Ansible Vault?**
When automating tasks using Ansible, it is crucial to avoid embedding sensitive information (like AWS credentials) directly in playbooks. Hardcoding credentials in plain text could expose them to anyone with access to the playbook, making them easy targets for malicious actors. Instead, Ansible Vault allows you to encrypt sensitive data and access it securely during playbook execution, ensuring that the secrets are not exposed.

### **How to Use Ansible Vault:**
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Ansible Vault to encrypt and manage sensitive data.

#### 1. **Encrypt the sensitive data**
You can encrypt a file containing sensitive information using the `ansible-vault encrypt` command. This will create an encrypted file that only authorized users can decrypt with a password.

- Example:
  ```bash
  ansible-vault encrypt aws_credentials.yml
  ```
  This command encrypts the file `aws_credentials.yml`, which may contain your AWS credentials, ensuring itâ€™s stored securely.

#### 2. **Reference the encrypted file in your playbook**
In your playbook, you should reference the encrypted vault file instead of hardcoding sensitive information directly. For example, you can use variables stored in an encrypted file to securely store credentials.

- Example playbook snippet:
  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Example Playbook Using Encrypted Secrets
    hosts: localhost
    vars_files:
      - aws_credentials.yml  # This references the encrypted file
    tasks:
      - name: Use AWS credentials
        ec2:
          key: "{{ aws_access_key_id }}"
          secret: "{{ aws_secret_access_key }}"
  ```

#### 3. **Run the playbook**
When running your playbook, Ansible will prompt you for the vault password (or you can specify it using a password file) to decrypt the sensitive data at runtime.

To run the playbook with a vault password file, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ec2.yml --vault-password-file vault.pass
```

**Explanation of the command:**
- `-i inventory.ini`: Specifies the inventory file that contains your target hosts.
- `ec2.yml`: The playbook that references the encrypted AWS credentials.
- `--vault-password-file vault.pass`: Specifies the vault password file, which is used by Ansible to decrypt the encrypted file at runtime.

By using this method, sensitive information like AWS credentials is kept secure during execution without being exposed directly in the playbook.

### **Additional Vault Commands:**
Here are some additional useful commands for working with Ansible Vault:

- **Edit an encrypted file**: To edit an encrypted file without manually decrypting it, you can use the `ansible-vault edit` command:
  ```bash
  ansible-vault edit aws_credentials.yml
  ```

- **Decrypt a file**: To decrypt a file, you can use the `ansible-vault decrypt` command:
  ```bash
  ansible-vault decrypt aws_credentials.yml
  ```

- **Re-encrypt a file**: If you modify an encrypted file and want to re-encrypt it, you can use the `ansible-vault reencrypt` command:
  ```bash
  ansible-vault reencrypt aws_credentials.yml
  ```

### **Conclusion:**
Using Ansible Vault ensures that sensitive data is securely encrypted and not exposed in plain text within your playbooks. By encrypting credentials and other sensitive information, you can automate tasks in a secure manner, protecting your infrastructure from unauthorized access and reducing the risk of data breaches.

# **Variables in Ansible:**

When working with Ansible, it's important to avoid hardcoding values. For example, if you are specifying an EC2 instance type like `t2.micro` directly in a playbook or role, it limits flexibility. If someone else wants to use a different instance type, they would have to manually edit the playbook. To solve this, we should use variables instead of hardcoding values. This allows anyone to change the value of the EC2 instance type according to their needs without modifying the playbook itself.

For instance, instead of hardcoding `t2.micro` in your playbook, you can define a variable like `ec2_instance_type` in one of the places mentioned below, and it can be updated or overridden based on the user's requirements:

```yaml
ec2_instance_type: t2.micro
```

**Where to Define Variables in Ansible:**

Variables in Ansible can be stored in different places, and they are evaluated in a specific order of precedence. Here are the primary locations where variables can be defined:

1. **Role Defaults (`defaults/main.yml`)**: These are the lowest priority variables. They are used when no other value is defined for a variable.

2. **Role Vars (`vars/main.yml`)**: These variables have a higher priority than `defaults`. If a variable is defined here, it will override any value from `defaults/main.yml`.

3. **Extra Variables (`-e` on the command line)**: These variables have the highest priority and will override any other defined variable. You can pass variables at runtime using the `-e` flag when executing the Ansible playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "ec2_instance_type=t3.large"
   ```

4. **Group Vars**: Variables can also be defined for specific groups in `group_vars`. This is useful when you need to specify variables that apply to all hosts in a specific group.

5. **Host Vars**: You can define variables specific to a single host in `host_vars` if the variable value is unique to that host.

---

**Example of Prioritization:**

1. **`defaults/main.yml`** (lowest priority):
   ```yaml
   ec2_instance_type: t2.micro
   ```

2. **`vars/main.yml`** (higher priority):
   ```yaml
   ec2_instance_type: t2.medium
   ```

3. **Command Line `-e`** (highest priority):
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "ec2_instance_type=t3.large"
   ```

In this case, if all three locations define `ec2_instance_type`, the final value will be `t3.large`, as it is passed via the command line (`-e`), which has the highest priority.

By defining variables in the appropriate locations, you allow for greater flexibility, easier customization, and better management of configurations across different environments. This approach avoids hardcoding values and ensures that changes can be made dynamically without modifying the underlying playbooks or roles.
