# Conditionals
Conditionals in Ansible are used to control the flow of tasks based on specific conditions. These conditions are evaluated during playbook execution, and depending on whether they are true or false, tasks are either executed or skipped. Conditionals can help make playbooks more dynamic and flexible, as you can tailor actions to specific variables, facts, or states.

### **Basic Syntax of Conditionals**

The general syntax for conditionals in Ansible is:
```yaml
- name: task_name
  module_name:
    key: value
  when: condition
```

- `when`: This is the keyword that introduces a conditional expression. If the expression evaluates to `True`, the task is executed. If it evaluates to `False`, the task is skipped.

### **Examples of Using Conditionals**

1. **Using Variables in Conditionals**
   You can use Ansible variables to decide whether a task should run. For instance, if you have a variable called `os_family` and you want to run a task only for Ubuntu (which is part of the Debian family), you can use a conditional like this:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install a package on Debian-based systems
     apt:
       name: "{{ package_name }}"
       state: present
     when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
   ```

   In this example, the task will only run on hosts that have `os_family` equal to `Debian` (e.g., Ubuntu, Mint, etc.).

2. **Using Boolean Expressions**
   You can use logical expressions (like `and`, `or`, `not`) to combine multiple conditions:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install a package only if it's not already installed
     apt:
       name: "{{ package_name }}"
       state: present
     when: ansible_facts['pkg_mgr'] == 'apt' and package_name not in ansible_facts['packages']
   ```

   This task will only run if the package manager is `apt` and the package is not already installed.

3. **Using `changed` to Run Tasks Only When Changes Happen**
   Ansible provides a built-in variable called `changed` that can be used to check if a task has already made a change. You can use it to conditionally run tasks based on whether previous tasks have altered the system.

   ```yaml
   - name: Run configuration if the file was changed
     command: "/path/to/some/command"
     when: result.changed == true
   ```

4. **Using `inventory_hostname` or `hostvars`**
   You can also conditionally run tasks based on the specific host or group of hosts by referencing `inventory_hostname` or `hostvars`:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install Apache on web servers
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: present
     when: inventory_hostname in groups['webservers']
   ```

   In this example, Apache will only be installed on hosts in the `webservers` group.

5. **Using Facts**
   Ansible automatically gathers facts about the hosts, and you can use these facts to determine whether a task should run. For example, if you want to install a package only on RedHat-based systems, you can check the `os_family`:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install a package on RedHat-based systems
     yum:
       name: "{{ package_name }}"
       state: present
     when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
   ```

### **Advanced Usage of Conditionals**

1. **Combining Multiple Conditions**
   You can combine multiple conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install Apache only if the OS is Debian and the system is not a virtual machine
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: present
     when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian" and ansible_facts['virtualization_type'] != "docker"
   ```

2. **Using Jinja2 Expressions**
   Ansible uses Jinja2 templating for evaluating conditions. You can use Jinja2 expressions in your conditionals, such as checking the existence of a file or comparing strings:

   ```yaml
   - name: Check if a file exists and restart service
     service:
       name: apache2
       state: restarted
     when: lookup('file', '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf') is defined
   ```

3. **Using `default` in Conditionals**
   Sometimes, variables may not be defined, and using them in conditions would cause errors. You can provide default values with `default()`:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install a package only if variable is defined
     apt:
       name: "{{ package_name | default('nginx') }}"
       state: present
     when: package_name is defined
   ```

   In this case, if `package_name` is not defined, the task will install `nginx` as a fallback.

### **Common Use Cases for Conditionals**

1. **Running Tasks Only for Certain Hosts:**
   You might want to run specific tasks only for certain hosts or groups of hosts.

   ```yaml
   - name: Perform task only on production hosts
     command: /bin/command
     when: inventory_hostname in groups['production']
   ```

2. **Running Tasks Based on Facts:**
   Ansible facts can be used to dynamically determine conditions, such as OS type, memory size, or package manager.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install a package on RedHat-based systems
     yum:
       name: nginx
       state: present
     when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
   ```

3. **Controlling Task Execution Based on Variables:**
   Often, you need to check whether a variable is set before running a task.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install a package only if variable is defined
     apt:
       name: "{{ package_name }}"
       state: present
     when: package_name is defined
   ```

### **Conclusion**

Conditionals in Ansible provide a powerful way to control the execution of tasks based on dynamic factors, such as variables, facts, or host group membership. By using `when`, you can make your playbooks more flexible, reusable, and responsive to different environments and conditions.
