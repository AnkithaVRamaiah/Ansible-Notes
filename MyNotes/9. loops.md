# Loops
In Ansible, loops allow you to repeat tasks multiple times with different input values. Loops are helpful when you want to perform the same task on multiple items, reducing redundancy and making your playbook more efficient and manageable. By using loops, you can apply the same set of instructions to a list of variables or items, instead of writing repetitive code.

### **Basic Syntax of Loops**

The most basic form of using a loop in Ansible is with the `loop` keyword, which iterates over a list or dictionary.

```yaml
- name: Task to repeat
  module_name:
    key: value
  loop: 
    - item1
    - item2
    - item3
```

In this example, the task will be executed three times, once for each item (`item1`, `item2`, and `item3`).

### **Common Loop Use Cases**

1. **Looping Over a List of Items**
   If you want to perform a task, like installing multiple packages, you can use a loop to iterate over the list of packages:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install multiple packages
     apt:
       name: "{{ item }}"
       state: present
     loop:
       - nginx
       - vim
       - git
   ```

   Here, Ansible will install the packages `nginx`, `vim`, and `git` one after another.

2. **Looping Over a Dictionary (Key-Value Pairs)**
   You can also loop over key-value pairs, where each pair can be processed by the task. This is useful for tasks that require both a key and a value, such as adding users or setting system configurations.

   ```yaml
   - name: Add multiple users
     user:
       name: "{{ item.key }}"
       state: present
       groups: "{{ item.value }}"
     loop:
       - { name: 'john', groups: 'sudo' }
       - { name: 'alice', groups: 'admins' }
       - { name: 'bob', groups: 'users' }
   ```

   This will create three users (`john`, `alice`, and `bob`), each assigned to a different group.

3. **Looping Over Files**
   You can use loops to work with multiple files, such as copying files to multiple locations or deleting them.

   ```yaml
   - name: Copy files to multiple directories
     copy:
       src: "{{ item }}"
       dest: "/tmp/{{ item }}"
     loop:
       - file1.txt
       - file2.txt
       - file3.txt
   ```

4. **Looping Over Hosts in the Inventory**
   You can use loops to apply tasks to all hosts or a specific group of hosts in the inventory:

   ```yaml
   - name: Ping all hosts
     ping:
     loop: "{{ groups['all'] }}"
   ```

   This will ping every host in the `all` group from your inventory.

### **Advanced Loop Usage**

1. **Loop with Indexes**
   Sometimes, you might want to know the index of the current item in the loop. You can use the `loop.index` or `loop.index0` variables to access the index (0-based or 1-based).

   ```yaml
   - name: Print index of items
     debug:
       msg: "Item {{ item }} is at index {{ loop.index }}"
     loop:
       - apple
       - banana
       - cherry
   ```

   This will output the index of each item in the list.

2. **Loop with Conditional Statements**
   You can combine loops with conditionals using `when` to only run specific tasks for certain items.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install selected packages only
     apt:
       name: "{{ item }}"
       state: present
     loop:
       - nginx
       - mysql
       - apache2
     when: item != 'mysql'
   ```

   In this case, Ansible will install `nginx` and `apache2`, but will skip `mysql`.

3. **Looping with Complex Variables**
   You can loop over complex variables like dictionaries or lists of dictionaries. For example, if you have a list of dictionaries containing package names and their states, you can loop over that.

   ```yaml
   - name: Ensure packages are present or absent
     apt:
       name: "{{ item.name }}"
       state: "{{ item.state }}"
     loop:
       - { name: 'nginx', state: 'present' }
       - { name: 'apache2', state: 'absent' }
   ```

   This example will install `nginx` and remove `apache2`.

4. **Using `with_items` vs `loop`**
   In earlier versions of Ansible, `with_items` was used for looping. However, `loop` is the preferred method now, as it provides more flexibility and clarity. `with_items` is still supported for backward compatibility, but it is being phased out in favor of `loop`.

   **Example with `with_items`:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Install multiple packages
     apt:
       name: "{{ item }}"
       state: present
     with_items:
       - nginx
       - vim
       - git
   ```

   **Same task using `loop`:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Install multiple packages
     apt:
       name: "{{ item }}"
       state: present
     loop:
       - nginx
       - vim
       - git
   ```

   The `loop` method is recommended because it's more versatile and works with other Ansible features like `loop_control`, `loop.index`, etc.

### **Special Loop Features**

1. **`loop_control`**
   The `loop_control` keyword allows you to control how the loop is executed. You can modify the default behavior by adjusting things like the loop index or specifying a custom variable name for the loop item.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install packages with custom loop control
     apt:
       name: "{{ item }}"
       state: present
     loop:
       - nginx
       - vim
       - git
     loop_control:
       label: "{{ item }}"
   ```

   Here, `loop_control` sets a custom label for the task to output the name of the item being processed.

2. **`loop` with `dict`**
   You can loop over a dictionary, which allows you to access both keys and values. 

   ```yaml
   - name: Create users with different roles
     user:
       name: "{{ item.key }}"
       groups: "{{ item.value }}"
       state: present
     loop: "{{ user_roles | dict2items }}"
   ```

   In this example, `user_roles` is a dictionary, and `dict2items` converts it into a list of key-value pairs, which can then be looped over.

### **Looping Summary**

- **Basic loops** are used to repeat tasks over lists, dictionaries, and other complex variables.
- **Loops reduce repetition** and make playbooks more efficient and readable.
- **Indexing and `loop_control`** can provide additional control over the loop behavior.
- **`with_items`** is a legacy feature, and `loop` is preferred for its flexibility and functionality.

Loops are powerful tools in Ansible, allowing for more dynamic and reusable playbooks. You can leverage them to handle tasks for multiple items or conditions, improving the maintainability and scalability of your automation.
