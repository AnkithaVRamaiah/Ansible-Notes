### **Ansible Roadmap**
#### **1. Introduction to Ansible**
- Understand what Ansible is and its key features.
- Learn about the **agentless architecture** and how it differs from other configuration management tools.
- Install Ansible on your local machine (Linux or macOS preferred).

#### **2. Ansible Basics**
- **Ansible Inventory**: Learn how to define hosts and groups of hosts.
- **Ad-hoc Commands**: Execute simple tasks using Ansible ad-hoc commands.
- **Modules**: Explore commonly used Ansible modules (e.g., `ping`, `command`, `copy`, `service`).

#### **3. Writing Playbooks**
- Understand what **playbooks** are and how they structure tasks.
- Learn about **YAML** syntax, as Ansible playbooks are written in YAML.
- Create simple playbooks to automate basic tasks (e.g., installing packages, starting services).

#### **4. Variables and Facts**
- Use **variables** to make playbooks more dynamic and reusable.
- Gather **facts** about managed hosts and use them in playbooks.

#### **5. Handlers and Conditions**
- Learn how to use **handlers** to perform actions when tasks change the state.
- Implement **conditional statements** to run tasks based on certain conditions.

#### **6. Loops and Templates**
- Use **loops** to repeat tasks with different inputs.
- Create **Jinja2 templates** for generating configuration files dynamically.

#### **7. Roles**
- Understand the concept of **roles** for organizing playbooks and tasks.
- Create roles to structure and reuse your Ansible code.

#### **8. Ansible Galaxy**
- Explore **Ansible Galaxy** for downloading pre-built roles.
- Learn how to upload and manage your own roles on Galaxy.

#### **9. Ansible Vault**
- Use **Ansible Vault** to securely manage sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
- Encrypt and decrypt data within your playbooks.

#### **10. Advanced Playbook Features**
- Implement **tags** to control which tasks run.
- Use **block**, **rescue**, and **always** for better error handling.
- Optimize playbooks with **delegate_to**, **run_once**, and **local_action**.

#### **11. Ansible Tower/AWX**
- Learn about **Ansible Tower** or **AWX** for managing Ansible playbooks with a web interface.
- Understand the features like **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**, **job templates**, and **workflow automation**.

#### **12. Ansible for DevOps**
- Integrate Ansible with **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Automate **infrastructure provisioning** (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- Use Ansible for **container orchestration** and **Kubernetes** management.

#### **13. Best Practices**
- Follow **best practices** for writing maintainable and scalable Ansible playbooks.
- Learn about **idempotency**, which ensures tasks don't make unnecessary changes.
- Use **Ansible Lint** to check for syntax and best practice errors in playbooks.

#### **14. Real-World Projects**
- Implement real-world automation scenarios like setting up web servers, configuring databases, or deploying applications.
- Participate in open-source projects or contribute to Ansible Galaxy.

#### **15. Certification (Optional)**
- Consider taking the **Red Hat Certified Specialist in Ansible Automation** exam for formal recognition of your skills.
