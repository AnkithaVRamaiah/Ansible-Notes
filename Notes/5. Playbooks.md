# Playboooks

In Ansible, **playbooks** are files that define automation tasks and configurations to be executed on managed hosts. They are written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) and are used to orchestrate the configuration of systems, deploy software, and manage complex IT workflows.

### Structure of a Playbook:
A typical playbook consists of **plays**. Each **play** targets a specific group of hosts and defines a set of tasks to execute. Here's an outline of the structure:

1. **Plays**: A play is a mapping of hosts (or groups of hosts) to a list of tasks. It defines what actions need to be performed on these hosts.

2. **Tasks**: These are the individual actions or commands to be executed on the target systems. Tasks are executed in order and can include modules like `apt`, `yum`, `copy`, `template`, etc.

3. **Roles**: Playbooks can reference roles, which are collections of tasks, variables, templates, and handlers. Roles are used for organizing and reusing common configurations.

4. **Variables**: You can define variables in the playbook to store values like hostnames, IP addresses, or credentials, which can then be referenced throughout the playbook.

5. **Handlers**: Handlers are special tasks that only run when notified by other tasks. Typically, handlers are used to restart services after configuration changes.

6. **Conditions and Loops**: Playbooks can use conditionals (like `when`) to execute tasks only if certain conditions are met. Loops allow tasks to be repeated for multiple items.

### Example Playbook:
```yaml
---
- name: Configure web server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes  # Elevate privileges if required
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Copy configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/local/config/file
        dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Restart Apache if config file changed
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
      when: ansible_facts['config_changed']  # Runs only if a certain condition is true
```

### Key Concepts:
- **Hosts**: The machines on which tasks will be executed. This can be a single machine, multiple machines, or groups defined in an inventory.
- **State**: An indicator of the desired state of a system (e.g., `present`, `absent`, `started`, `stopped`).
- **Become**: A keyword used to escalate privileges (e.g., to `root` or `sudo`) if needed.

Playbooks allow for repeatable and scalable automation of IT tasks, improving the efficiency and consistency of system configuration.

# YAML Syntax

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format used for configuration files, data exchange, and more. It is widely used in Ansible playbooks because of its simplicity and readability.

### Basic Structure

- **Key-Value Pairs**: YAML represents data as key-value pairs.
  ```yaml
  key: value
  ```

- **Indentation**: YAML uses indentation (usually 2 spaces) to represent hierarchy. It does not support tabs.
  ```yaml
  parent:
    child: value
  ```

- **Lists**: Lists are represented with a dash followed by a space.
  ```yaml
  fruits:
    - apple
    - banana
    - cherry
  ```

- **Dictionaries**: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
  ```yaml
  person:
    name: John
    age: 30
  ```

### Ansible Playbook Structure

In Ansible, a playbook is written in YAML and contains one or more plays. A play typically runs a series of tasks on a group of hosts.

Hereâ€™s a simple playbook structure:

```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: webservers  # Specify target hosts
  become: yes  # Run with escalated privileges (sudo)
  tasks:  # List of tasks to run
    - name: Install nginx
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

### Playbook Elements

1. **Hosts**: Defines the target hosts on which the tasks will be executed (can be a group of hosts).
2. **Name**: Describes what the playbook or task does.
3. **Tasks**: A list of actions to perform on the specified hosts.
4. **Module**: A specific Ansible action like `package`, `copy`, `command`, etc., is defined with parameters. 

### Variables in YAML

Variables in Ansible can be defined in the playbook as follows:

```yaml
---
- name: Install a package
  hosts: webservers
  vars:
    package_name: nginx
  tasks:
    - name: Install the package
      package:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present
```

### Conditionals and Loops

You can include conditions and loops in Ansible playbooks.

**Conditionals**:
```yaml
- name: Install nginx only if not present
  package:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
```

**Loops**:
```yaml
- name: Install a list of packages
  package:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - nginx
    - git
    - vim
```

### Handlers

Handlers are tasks that are triggered by other tasks when a certain condition is met. They typically handle actions like restarting a service after a configuration change.

```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure nginx
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      notify: Restart nginx

  handlers:
    - name: Restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

### Comments

YAML allows comments using the `#` symbol:
```yaml
# This is a comment
key: value
```

### Example Playbook

Here is a more complete example of an Ansible playbook written in YAML:

```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    package_name: nginx
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx package
      package:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present

    - name: Start nginx service
      service:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: started

  handlers:
    - name: Restart nginx
      service:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: restarted
```

This playbook will install and start nginx on a group of hosts defined as `webservers`. It uses the `package` module to install nginx and the `service` module to start the service. The playbook also includes a handler that restarts nginx if the configuration changes.

Understanding YAML syntax is essential for effectively writing and managing Ansible playbooks. It helps to structure and organize tasks, variables, and configurations efficiently, making automation and infrastructure management more streamlined.

# Playbook

Simple Ansible playbooks that automate basic tasks like installing packages and starting services.

### 1. **Playbook to Install Packages**
This playbook installs packages on the target machine(s).

```yaml
---
- name: Install basic packages
  hosts: all
  become: yes  # Use sudo to run tasks as root
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache web server
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present  # Ensures the package is installed

    - name: Install Nginx web server
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

### 2. **Playbook to Start Services**
This playbook ensures that the required services are started on the target machine(s).

```yaml
---
- name: Start services
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started  # Ensures the service is running

    - name: Start Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

### 3. **Playbook to Install Packages and Start Services**
Combining both tasks, this playbook installs packages and then starts the corresponding services.

```yaml
---
- name: Install packages and start services
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache web server
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Install Nginx web server
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started

    - name: Start Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

### Explanation:
- **`apt`**: This module is used for package management in Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu). `state: present` ensures the package is installed.
- **`service`**: This module is used to manage services. `state: started` ensures the service is running.
- **`become: yes`**: This elevates privileges to `root` (sudo) to perform tasks requiring administrative access.

You can save these playbooks as `.yml` files and run them using the `ansible-playbook` command. For example:
```bash
ansible-playbook install_and_start_services.yml
```
