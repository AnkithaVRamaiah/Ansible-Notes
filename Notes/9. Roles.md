# Ansible roles

In Ansible, **roles** are a way to organize and structure your playbooks and tasks, making them reusable and easier to maintain. Roles help break down complex playbooks into smaller, more manageable pieces, each dedicated to a specific function or task.

Here's how roles work in Ansible:

### Structure of a Role
A role is a directory structure that contains all the necessary components for a specific task. The default structure of an Ansible role looks like this:

```
roles/
  myrole/
    defaults/
      main.yml         # Default variables for the role
    files/
      myfile.txt       # Files to be copied to the remote machine
    handlers/
      main.yml         # Handlers that can be triggered by tasks
    meta/
      main.yml         # Metadata about the role
    tasks/
      main.yml         # The main tasks to be executed by the role
    templates/
      mytemplate.j2    # Templates to be rendered and copied to the remote machine
    vars/
      main.yml         # Role-specific variables
```

### Key Components of a Role:
1. **defaults/main.yml**: Contains default variables for the role. These are the variables that are used unless explicitly overridden in other parts of the playbook or at runtime.
  
2. **files/**: Stores files that can be copied to remote systems during playbook execution.

3. **handlers/main.yml**: Defines the handlers for the role. Handlers are tasks that only run if triggered by other tasks, such as restarting a service.

4. **meta/main.yml**: Contains metadata about the role, like dependencies on other roles.

5. **tasks/main.yml**: This is the main file containing tasks that define the actions to be executed. It is usually where you place most of the tasks specific to the role.

6. **templates/**: Contains Jinja2 templates that will be processed and copied to remote systems. This allows for dynamic configuration.

7. **vars/main.yml**: Contains role-specific variables that can be used to define values within the role.

### Using Roles in Playbooks:
To use a role in a playbook, you simply reference it under the `roles` section of your playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - myrole
```

In this example, Ansible will look for a role named `myrole` in the `roles/` directory and execute the tasks defined in the role.

### Benefits of Using Roles:
- **Modularity**: Roles allow you to organize and modularize your playbooks. This makes it easier to reuse tasks and configurations across different playbooks.
- **Reusability**: Once a role is created, it can be reused in multiple playbooks, reducing duplication of code.
- **Scalability**: Roles make it easier to scale playbooks, especially in large environments with many servers, by breaking them into smaller tasks.
- **Collaboration**: Different teams or contributors can focus on specific roles without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes. Each team can maintain their own role, making collaboration smoother.

In summary, roles are a powerful feature in Ansible that helps organize tasks, variables, files, and handlers in a clear and structured way, making your automation tasks easier to maintain and scale.

# To create roles in Ansible and structure your code for reuse, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure for the Role
Ansible roles follow a specific directory structure. You can create this structure manually or use the `ansible-galaxy` command to generate the basic setup.

#### Using `ansible-galaxy` Command:
To create a role using the `ansible-galaxy` command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy init myrole
```

This will generate a directory structure for the role `myrole`. The basic structure looks like this:

```
myrole/
  defaults/
    main.yml
  files/
  handlers/
    main.yml
  meta/
    main.yml
  tasks/
    main.yml
  templates/
  vars/
    main.yml
```

If you want to create the role structure manually, you can do it like this:

```bash
mkdir -p myrole/{defaults,files,handlers,meta,tasks,templates,vars}
```

### Step 2: Define Role Components

#### 1. **defaults/main.yml**: Default Variables
In this file, you define default variables for your role. These variables can be overridden in other places, like in the playbook or inventory.

Example `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
# Default variables for myrole
app_name: "myapp"
app_version: "1.0"
```

#### 2. **files/**: Files to Copy to Remote Machines
You can add any files that need to be copied to the remote systems in this directory. For example, you might include configuration files, executables, or scripts.

Example file:
```bash
# Copy example file to the remote server
cp myfile.txt myrole/files/
```

#### 3. **handlers/main.yml**: Handlers to Trigger
Handlers are special tasks that run only when notified by other tasks. For example, you might want to restart a service when a configuration file is modified.

Example `handlers/main.yml`:
```yaml
# Restart the application service if configuration changes
- name: restart app
  service:
    name: "{{ app_name }}"
    state: restarted
```

#### 4. **meta/main.yml**: Metadata and Dependencies
This file contains metadata about your role, including its dependencies on other roles.

Example `meta/main.yml`:
```yaml
# Metadata for myrole
dependencies:
  - { role: anotherrole, some_var: value }
```

#### 5. **tasks/main.yml**: Main Tasks
This file contains the tasks that the role will perform. You can define multiple tasks in this file, which will be executed sequentially.

Example `tasks/main.yml`:
```yaml
# Tasks for installing and configuring the application
- name: Install package
  apt:
    name: "{{ app_name }}"
    state: present

- name: Copy configuration file
  template:
    src: "config.j2"
    dest: "/etc/{{ app_name }}/config"

- name: Start the application
  service:
    name: "{{ app_name }}"
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  notify:
    - restart app
```

#### 6. **templates/**: Templates for Configuration Files
In this directory, you can store Jinja2 templates, which will be rendered with variables and copied to the target machines. 

Example `templates/config.j2`:
```jinja
# Configuration template for {{ app_name }}
version: {{ app_version }}
```

#### 7. **vars/main.yml**: Role-specific Variables
You can define role-specific variables that are not meant to be overridden.

Example `vars/main.yml`:
```yaml
# Role-specific variables for myrole
installation_dir: "/opt/{{ app_name }}"
```

### Step 3: Use the Role in a Playbook
Once the role is created, you can use it in a playbook by specifying it under the `roles` section.

Example playbook:
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - myrole
```

This playbook will execute the tasks defined in the `myrole` role, including the tasks, handlers, and templates.

### Step 4: Run the Playbook
Finally, run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

### Benefits of Using Roles
- **Reusability**: Once a role is created, it can be reused across different playbooks.
- **Organization**: Roles help organize your playbook into smaller, manageable components.
- **Scalability**: Roles can be shared and used in large environments with many servers.
- **Maintainability**: Each role is self-contained, making it easier to maintain and update specific parts of your infrastructure.

By creating and using roles, you can structure your Ansible automation code efficiently and ensure that it is scalable and reusable.
