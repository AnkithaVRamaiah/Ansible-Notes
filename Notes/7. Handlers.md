# Handlers

In Ansible, **handlers** are special tasks that are used to perform actions when other tasks change the state of the system. Handlers are typically used for actions such as restarting services, reloading configurations, or notifying external systems. Handlers are executed only when notified by other tasks that have changed the system's state (i.e., they have made modifications).

### Steps to use Handlers in Ansible:

1. **Define a Handler:**
   Handlers are defined in the `handlers` section of the playbook. A handler looks similar to a regular task but will only run when it is explicitly notified by another task.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   handlers:
     - name: Restart service
       service:
         name: httpd
         state: restarted
   ```

2. **Notify a Handler:**
   A task can notify a handler by using the `notify` directive. If the task makes changes (e.g., a file is modified), the handler will be triggered to perform an action.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: Install httpd package
       yum:
         name: httpd
         state: present
       notify: Restart service  # Notify the handler to restart the service
   ```

3. **Control the Frequency of Handler Execution:**
   Handlers are only executed once, even if multiple tasks notify them. If multiple tasks notify the same handler, it will only run after all tasks have completed, but it will run only once.

4. **Example Playbook:**

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook with Handlers
     hosts: webservers
     become: yes

     tasks:
       - name: Install httpd package
         yum:
           name: httpd
           state: present
         notify: Restart service  # Notify handler to restart service

       - name: Copy custom index.html
         copy:
           src: /path/to/custom_index.html
           dest: /var/www/html/index.html
         notify: Restart service  # Notify handler to restart service

     handlers:
       - name: Restart service
         service:
           name: httpd
           state: restarted
   ```

### Key Points:
- **Handlers are only triggered if a task changes the system's state** (e.g., modifying a file, installing a package).
- **A handler is executed only once** no matter how many times it is notified.
- Handlers are usually used for operations like restarting services or reloading configurations.

Handlers provide a more efficient way of managing changes because they ensure that costly actions (like restarting a service) are only executed once, even if multiple tasks trigger the handler.

# Conditional statements

In Ansible, you can implement **conditional statements** to execute tasks based on specific conditions using the `when` keyword. This allows you to control whether a task should run or not depending on the outcome of a previous task, variable values, or other conditions.

### Basic Syntax:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Task to run only when condition is true
    debug:
      msg: "The condition is true!"
    when: condition_variable == true
```

### Examples:

#### 1. Running a Task Based on a Variable Value
This task runs only if the `install_package` variable is set to `true`.

```yaml
- name: Install a package
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - vim
    - git
  when: install_package == true
```

#### 2. Checking the Operating System Type
This task only runs on Ubuntu-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.).

```yaml
- name: Install package on Ubuntu
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - vim
    - git
  when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
```

#### 3. Using Multiple Conditions
You can use `and`, `or` to combine multiple conditions.

```yaml
- name: Install Apache if OS is Ubuntu and install_package is true
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian' and install_package == true
```

#### 4. Conditional Task Execution Based on Host
Run a task only if the host is `webserver`:

```yaml
- name: Configure web server
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
  when: inventory_hostname == 'webserver'
```

#### 5. Negating a Condition
If you want to run a task when a condition is not true, you can negate it using `not`.

```yaml
- name: Run task if variable is not true
  debug:
    msg: "This task runs when condition_variable is not true"
  when: condition_variable is not true
```

These examples illustrate how Ansibleâ€™s `when` keyword can be used to conditionally execute tasks, making playbooks more flexible and tailored to different environments or conditions.
