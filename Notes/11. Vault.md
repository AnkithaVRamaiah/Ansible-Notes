# Ansible Vault

Ansible Vault is a feature in Ansible that allows you to securely store sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or any other sensitive information in encrypted files. You can then use this encrypted data within your playbooks or roles.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use Ansible Vault to manage sensitive data:

### 1. **Create an Encrypted File**
   To create an encrypted file, use the `ansible-vault create` command. You’ll be prompted to enter a password to secure the file.

   ```bash
   ansible-vault create secrets.yml
   ```

   This command will open an editor where you can add your sensitive data. For example:

   ```yaml
   db_password: "supersecretpassword"
   api_key: "abcdef123456"
   ```

   Save and close the file. The `secrets.yml` file is now encrypted.

### 2. **Edit an Encrypted File**
   If you need to edit the encrypted file later, use the `ansible-vault edit` command:

   ```bash
   ansible-vault edit secrets.yml
   ```

   This will open the file in your default editor, allowing you to modify it. When you save and close the file, the changes will be encrypted.

### 3. **Decrypt an Encrypted File**
   To view the contents of an encrypted file without editing, you can decrypt it temporarily with the following command:

   ```bash
   ansible-vault view secrets.yml
   ```

   This will print the decrypted content to the terminal.

### 4. **Use the Encrypted File in Playbooks**
   You can reference the encrypted file in your Ansible playbooks. For example, you might want to use the sensitive data from the `secrets.yml` file in a playbook:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example playbook using Vault
     hosts: localhost
     vars_files:
       - secrets.yml
     tasks:
       - name: Show DB password
         debug:
           msg: "The DB password is {{ db_password }}"
   ```

### 5. **Run Playbooks with Vault**
   To run a playbook that includes encrypted data, use the `--ask-vault-pass` option to prompt for the vault password, or use `--vault-password-file` to provide the password automatically from a file.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use a vault password file:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
   ```

### 6. **Encrypt an Existing File**
   If you already have a file with sensitive data and want to encrypt it, use the `ansible-vault encrypt` command:

   ```bash
   ansible-vault encrypt plain_file.yml
   ```

   This will encrypt `plain_file.yml` and replace it with the encrypted version.

### 7. **Decrypt a File**
   If you need to decrypt a file for any reason, use the following command:

   ```bash
   ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
   ```

### 8. **Change Vault Password**
   You can change the password for an encrypted file using the `ansible-vault rekey` command:

   ```bash
   ansible-vault rekey secrets.yml
   ```

   This will prompt you for the old password and then ask for the new password.

### Conclusion
Ansible Vault provides an effective way to manage sensitive data securely within your infrastructure. By encrypting your secrets, you can safely use them in your automation workflows without exposing them in plain text.

# encrypt and decrypt data

You can encrypt and decrypt data directly within your Ansible playbooks using **Ansible Vault**. This is useful for protecting sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and other secrets while still using them within your automation.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to encrypt and decrypt data directly within playbooks:

### 1. **Encrypting Data in Playbooks**
You can use the `ansible-vault encrypt_string` command to encrypt a specific value, which you can then directly include in your playbook. This way, the sensitive data remains encrypted but is still usable in the playbook.

#### Example: Encrypting a Single Value
Let's encrypt a sensitive string such as a password and use it in a playbook.

Run the following command to encrypt a string:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'my_secret_password' --name 'db_password'
```

This command will output an encrypted string that looks something like this:

```yaml
db_password: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          35353339393333626266623430396136653164383535333430323138343836666538306236643532
          6230303531343964646335353866613834313865623361370a643766613039353736653262356635
          34316364386539326561616263313661633739396335666133316664326333636561666264373965
          33396331316561643735313434353366616232303961666363366465
```

You can now paste this directly into your playbook.

#### Example Playbook with Encrypted String

```yaml
---
- name: Example playbook using encrypted data
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    db_password: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          35353339393333626266623430396136653164383535333430323138343836666538306236643532
          6230303531343964646335353866613834313865623361370a643766613039353736653262356635
          34316364386539326561616263313661633739396335666133316664326333636561666264373965
          33396331316561643735313434353366616232303961666363366465
  tasks:
    - name: Show encrypted DB password
      debug:
        msg: "The DB password is {{ db_password }}"
```

In the above example, the `db_password` variable is encrypted, and you can still use it in the playbook for other tasks.

### 2. **Decrypting Data within Playbooks**
When you run a playbook that uses encrypted data, Ansible automatically decrypts it as long as you provide the vault password either through `--ask-vault-pass` or `--vault-password-file`.

#### Running the Playbook with Vault Password
To run the playbook, use one of these two options to provide the vault password:

##### Option 1: Using `--ask-vault-pass`

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

This will prompt you to enter the vault password when executing the playbook.

##### Option 2: Using `--vault-password-file`

If you want to automate the password input, you can store the password in a file (e.g., `~/.vault_pass.txt`) and reference it during the playbook run:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
```

### 3. **Encrypting Entire Files in Playbooks**
You can also encrypt an entire file (such as a configuration file) and reference it in your playbook.

For example, let's assume we have a file `secrets.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml
db_password: "supersecretpassword"
```

To encrypt this file, run:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
```

This will encrypt the entire contents of `secrets.yml` and the file will now look like this (with encrypted content):

```yaml
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
32343334353637343536383639383735363739383938373039303132333435363738393030343536
```

You can now reference this encrypted file within your playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Example playbook using encrypted file
  hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Show encrypted DB password
      debug:
        msg: "The DB password is {{ db_password }}"
```

### 4. **Decryption and Vault Management**
To manually decrypt a file or string, use the following commands:

#### Decrypting a File
```bash
ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
```

#### Decrypting a String
For a string that you’ve previously encrypted using `ansible-vault encrypt_string`, you can decrypt it with the following:

```bash
ansible-vault decrypt_string 'your_encrypted_string'
```

### 5. **Changing the Vault Password**
If you need to change the password for an encrypted file or string, use the `ansible-vault rekey` command:

```bash
ansible-vault rekey secrets.yml
```

This will prompt for the old and new passwords.

### Conclusion
By using **Ansible Vault**, you can securely manage sensitive data within your playbooks, ensuring that passwords and secrets are encrypted while still being usable within your automation tasks. The `encrypt_string` and `vars_files` features allow for granular control over sensitive data in your infrastructure.
