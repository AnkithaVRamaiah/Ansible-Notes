# Ansible loops

In Ansible, loops allow you to repeat a task with different inputs, making it more efficient to apply the same logic to multiple items. Here's an example of how to use loops in Ansible:

### Example 1: Using `loop` with a list

Suppose you want to install multiple packages on a server. Instead of writing multiple `apt` tasks, you can loop through the list of packages.

```yaml
---
- name: Install multiple packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - nginx
        - vim
        - curl
```

### Example 2: Using `loop` with a dictionary

You can also use a dictionary with key-value pairs, for example, to configure users with different groups and states.

```yaml
---
- name: Configure users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add users
      user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        group: "{{ item.group }}"
        state: "{{ item.state }}"
      loop:
        - { name: "user1", group: "admin", state: "present" }
        - { name: "user2", group: "sudo", state: "present" }
        - { name: "user3", group: "users", state: "absent" }
```

### Example 3: Using `loop` with a file

You can also loop over a list of files or directories to create them.

```yaml
---
- name: Create directories
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create directories
      file:
        path: "{{ item }}"
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'
      loop:
        - /tmp/dir1
        - /tmp/dir2
        - /tmp/dir3
```

### Example 4: Using `with_items` (older version)

Ansible also supports `with_items`, which is the older syntax for loops. It's now recommended to use `loop`, but you may still encounter this syntax in some older playbooks.

```yaml
---
- name: Install multiple packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items:
        - nginx
        - vim
        - curl
```

### Conclusion

- The `loop` directive is the most modern and recommended approach to iterate over lists or dictionaries in Ansible tasks.
- It simplifies the playbook and eliminates the need for repeated code.

# Jinja2 templates

In Ansible, **Jinja2 templates** are used to dynamically generate configuration files by replacing variables and expressions in template files with actual values. You can create a Jinja2 template and use it to generate configuration files based on your inventory or other variables.

Here's how you can use Jinja2 templates in Ansible to generate configuration files dynamically:

### 1. Create a Jinja2 Template (e.g., `nginx.conf.j2`)
First, create a template file with `.j2` extension (e.g., `nginx.conf.j2`). This file will have placeholders for dynamic values that Ansible will replace.

```jinja
# nginx.conf.j2
server {
    listen {{ nginx_port }};
    server_name {{ server_name }};

    location / {
        root {{ document_root }};
        index index.html index.htm;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;
    location = /40x.html {
    }
}
```

In this template:
- `{{ nginx_port }}`, `{{ server_name }}`, and `{{ document_root }}` are placeholders that will be replaced with values provided by Ansible.

### 2. Create the Playbook (e.g., `deploy_nginx.yml`)
Next, create an Ansible playbook that uses the template to generate the configuration file dynamically.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Nginx configuration
  hosts: webservers
  vars:
    nginx_port: 80
    server_name: example.com
    document_root: /usr/share/nginx/html

  tasks:
    - name: Generate Nginx configuration from template
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

### Explanation:
- **`vars`** section: Defines the values that will be used to replace the placeholders in the Jinja2 template.
- **`template` module**: This Ansible module processes the Jinja2 template and copies the generated content to the target file (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`).

### 3. Run the Playbook
To apply this configuration, run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook deploy_nginx.yml
```

This will:
1. Replace the placeholders in `nginx.conf.j2` with the values defined in the `vars` section of the playbook.
2. Copy the resulting configuration file to the target location on the remote server (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`).

### 4. Customizing the Template
You can make the template more flexible by using variables, loops, and conditional statements. For example:

```jinja
# nginx.conf.j2
server {
    listen {{ nginx_port }};
    server_name {{ server_name }};
    root {{ document_root }};
    
    {% if enable_ssl %}
    ssl_certificate {{ ssl_certificate }};
    ssl_certificate_key {{ ssl_certificate_key }};
    {% endif %}

    location / {
        index index.html index.htm;
    }
}
```

In this example, if `enable_ssl` is `True`, the SSL settings will be included in the generated configuration.
