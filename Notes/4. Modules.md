# Modules

Ansible **modules** are like mini-programs that do specific tasks for you. Each module is designed to perform one kind of task, like installing software or checking if something is running. You use these modules in your **playbooks** to tell Ansible what to do.

Here are some commonly used **Ansible modules**:

### 1. **ping** Module
- **What it does**: It checks if a system is reachable and responds. It's a simple way to test if Ansible can connect to the machine you're managing.
- **Example**: You can use this module to see if a server is up and running.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Check if the server is reachable
    ansible.builtin.ping:
  ```

### 2. **yum** Module
- **What it does**: Installs, removes, or updates packages on **RedHat-based** systems (like CentOS or Fedora).
- **Example**: You can use this module to install software packages on a server.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Install nginx
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: nginx
      state: present
  ```

### 3. **apt** Module
- **What it does**: Similar to the `yum` module but for **Debian-based** systems (like Ubuntu).
- **Example**: This installs a package (e.g., `nginx`) on Ubuntu.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Install nginx on Ubuntu
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
  ```

### 4. **copy** Module
- **What it does**: Copies a file from your local machine to a remote machine.
- **Example**: You can use this to upload configuration files to your servers.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Copy configuration file to the server
    ansible.builtin.copy:
      src: /path/to/local/file
      dest: /path/to/remote/file
  ```

### 5. **file** Module
- **What it does**: Manages file properties such as permissions, ownership, and file state (whether a file should exist or not).
- **Example**: You can use this to set the permissions on a file.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Set file permissions
    ansible.builtin.file:
      path: /path/to/file
      mode: '0644'
  ```

### 6. **service** Module
- **What it does**: Manages system services, like starting, stopping, or restarting services.
- **Example**: You can use this to ensure that a service (e.g., nginx) is running.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Start nginx service
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: nginx
      state: started
  ```

### 7. **command** Module
- **What it does**: Runs commands on a remote machine.
- **Example**: You can use this to run shell commands, like checking disk space.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Run a command to check disk space
    ansible.builtin.command:
      cmd: df -h
  ```

### 8. **git** Module
- **What it does**: Manages Git repositories, such as cloning or updating a repository.
- **Example**: You can use this to clone a repository on your server.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Clone a Git repository
    ansible.builtin.git:
      repo: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
      dest: /path/to/destination
  ```

### 9. **docker_container** Module
- **What it does**: Manages Docker containers (e.g., starting, stopping, or removing containers).
- **Example**: You can use this to start a Docker container.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Start a Docker container
    ansible.builtin.docker_container:
      name: my_container
      image: nginx
      state: started
  ```

### 10. **wait_for** Module
- **What it does**: Waits for a condition to be true (like waiting for a port to open or a file to appear).
- **Example**: You can use this to wait for a port to be open before moving on to the next task.
- **Usage**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Wait for port 80 to be open
    ansible.builtin.wait_for:
      port: 80
      state: started
  ```

### Summary:
- **ping**: Test if a system is reachable.
- **yum/apt**: Install packages (for RedHat or Debian-based systems).
- **copy**: Copy files between systems.
- **file**: Manage file properties (permissions, ownership).
- **service**: Manage system services (start/stop).
- **command**: Run commands on remote systems.
- **git**: Manage Git repositories.
- **docker_container**: Manage Docker containers.
- **wait_for**: Wait for conditions to be true (like ports opening).

These modules help you automate many tasks without having to manually do them on each system!
