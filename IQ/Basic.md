### Basic Ansible Questions

### 1. **What is Ansible?**
   Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and multi-node orchestration. It is agentless, meaning it does not require any special software to be installed on the target machines, relying instead on SSH (for Linux/Unix) or WinRM (for Windows) to communicate with remote systems.

### 2. **What are the main advantages of using Ansible over other configuration management tools like Puppet and Chef?**
   - **Simplicity:** Ansible uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) for its playbooks, which is easy to read and write.
   - **Agentless:** Unlike Puppet and Chef, Ansible does not require agents to be installed on target machines, reducing overhead.
   - **Idempotence:** Ansible ensures that operations are repeatable without changing the system if it’s already in the desired state.
   - **Scalability:** It works well in large-scale environments with ease.
   - **No Dependencies:** Ansible doesn’t require a central server or special client-side software, which simplifies its setup.
   - **Extensive Library of Modules:** Ansible offers a rich set of modules for automating almost every system administration task.

### 3. **What is an Ansible playbook?**
   An Ansible playbook is a YAML file containing a series of tasks, executed sequentially on the target machines. Playbooks define what configuration should be applied to the managed systems and in what order. Playbooks can also include variables, handlers, and other advanced features to orchestrate complex tasks.

### 4. **What is the difference between a playbook and a role in Ansible?**
   - **Playbook:** A playbook is a collection of plays that define the tasks to be executed on target systems. It is the primary way to define automation in Ansible.
   - **Role:** A role is a way of organizing playbooks and related files (such as variables, tasks, templates, etc.). It allows you to create reusable units of automation that can be easily shared and reused across multiple playbooks.

### 5. **What are Ansible modules, and how do they work?**
   Ansible modules are the building blocks of Ansible tasks. They are scripts that are executed by Ansible to perform specific actions on target machines, such as installing a package, creating a file, or starting a service. Modules can be used within playbooks and are invoked by Ansible during task execution. They are typically idempotent, meaning they won't make changes if the target is already in the desired state.

### 6. **What are Ansible inventories?**
   An Ansible inventory is a file (or set of files) that lists the hosts that Ansible manages. It contains information about the systems to which Ansible will connect and configure. Inventories can be static (e.g., a simple text file) or dynamic (e.g., generated by an external script or cloud provider).

### 7. **What are the components of an Ansible architecture?**
   Ansible architecture consists of the following components:
   - **Control Node:** The machine where Ansible is installed and from which tasks are executed.
   - **Managed Nodes:** The remote machines that Ansible manages, which can be any system with SSH access (Linux/Unix) or WinRM access (Windows).
   - **Inventory:** A list of managed nodes.
   - **Modules:** Executable units of code used by Ansible to perform tasks.
   - **Playbooks:** YAML files defining automation logic.
   - **API/Plugins:** Interfaces that allow Ansible to interact with other systems or services.

### 8. **What are the types of inventories supported by Ansible?**
   Ansible supports two main types of inventories:
   - **Static Inventory:** A simple file (usually in INI or YAML format) listing all the managed hosts and their associated variables.
   - **Dynamic Inventory:** An inventory generated dynamically using a script, often used with cloud environments (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure), where the list of managed nodes can change frequently.

### 9. **How does Ansible connect to remote machines to execute tasks?**
   Ansible typically connects to remote machines using SSH (for Linux/Unix systems) or WinRM (for Windows systems). It does not require an agent to be installed on the remote machines. Ansible establishes an SSH or WinRM connection to execute tasks, collects the output, and then disconnects.

### 10. **What is an Ansible task, and how is it different from a play?**
   - **Task:** A task is a single unit of work in Ansible that uses a specific module to perform an action (such as installing a package, creating a file, or running a command). Tasks are executed in the order they appear in the playbook.
   - **Play:** A play is a group of tasks that are executed on a particular set of hosts (or group of hosts) defined in the playbook. A play can contain multiple tasks, and it also defines additional information like variables, handlers, and the set of hosts to target.

### 11. **What is the purpose of the `ansible.cfg` file?**
   The `ansible.cfg` file is the configuration file for Ansible, where you can define various settings to control Ansible's behavior. This includes settings for inventory location, SSH options, connection types, logging, and other operational parameters. The file can be placed in several locations, such as the current directory, the user's home directory, or `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`. It helps customize and fine-tune Ansible’s operations across environments.

### 12. **How do you manage sensitive data in Ansible?**
   Sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and private keys should be managed securely. Ansible provides several ways to manage sensitive data:
   - **Ansible Vault:** Ansible Vault is a tool for encrypting sensitive data in Ansible. You can encrypt variables, files, or entire playbooks to keep sensitive data secure.
   - **Environment Variables:** Another way to handle sensitive data is by using environment variables, particularly for passwords or API keys that should not be hardcoded in playbooks.
   - **External Secrets Management Tools:** You can also integrate with external tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to securely manage and access sensitive data.

### 13. **What is Ansible Vault, and why is it used?**
   Ansible Vault is a feature of Ansible that allows you to encrypt sensitive data within your Ansible projects, such as passwords, API keys, and other secret values. It ensures that sensitive data remains secure while being used in playbooks or inventory files. Vault uses symmetric encryption, and you can create encrypted files that can be decrypted at runtime or during execution. This feature is crucial for ensuring that sensitive data does not appear in plaintext in source code repositories.

### 14. **What is the difference between Ansible and SSH?**
   Ansible and SSH are related but serve different purposes:
   - **SSH (Secure Shell):** SSH is a protocol used for secure communication between systems over a network. It allows administrators to remotely access and manage servers.
   - **Ansible:** Ansible is an automation tool that uses SSH (or WinRM for Windows) to connect to remote systems and execute tasks such as configuration management, deployment, and orchestration. It uses SSH to manage the connection and execution of tasks but adds layers of abstraction and automation beyond simple remote login.

### 15. **How do you install Ansible on a system?**
   Ansible can be installed on most Linux systems using package managers, or you can install it via Python's package manager (pip). Below are a few installation methods:
   - **Using `apt` (for Debian/Ubuntu):**
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ansible
     ```
   - **Using `yum` (for RHEL/CentOS/Fedora):**
     ```bash
     sudo yum install ansible
     ```
   - **Using `pip` (for any system with Python):**
     ```bash
     pip install ansible
     ```
   - **Using `dnf` (for Fedora):**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install ansible
     ```

### 16. **What is an Ansible handler?**
   An Ansible handler is a special type of task that is only run when notified by other tasks. Handlers are often used for tasks like restarting services after changes have been made, such as when a configuration file is modified. Handlers are typically idempotent, meaning they will only run if something has changed and requires the action.

### 17. **What is an Ansible fact?**
   An Ansible fact is information about a system that Ansible collects during execution. Facts are gathered automatically at the beginning of a playbook run and provide details such as system architecture, IP addresses, memory, CPU, disk space, and operating system. You can access these facts in playbooks using the `ansible_facts` dictionary, and they help with making decisions or applying conditionals during task execution.

### 18. **How do you define variables in an Ansible playbook?**
   Variables in an Ansible playbook can be defined in several ways:
   - **Inline within tasks:** Directly inside the playbook or role using YAML syntax.
     ```yaml
     - name: Install a package
       ansible.builtin.yum:
         name: "{{ package_name }}"
         state: present
     ```
   - **In `vars` section of a playbook or role:** You can define variables at the start of a playbook or in the `vars` section.
     ```yaml
     vars:
       package_name: httpd
     ```
   - **In `defaults` section of a role:** You can define default values for variables in a role's `defaults/main.yml` file.
   - **In external files:** You can use `include_vars` to import variable files from external sources like YAML or JSON files.

### 19. **What is the purpose of the `ansible-playbook` command?**
   The `ansible-playbook` command is used to run Ansible playbooks. It is the primary command to execute automation tasks. When you run `ansible-playbook`, Ansible interprets the YAML playbook file, connects to the target hosts, and runs the tasks defined in the playbook. You can specify various options with this command, such as inventory files, extra variables, and tags for controlling the execution flow.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml
   ```

### 20. **What is the `hosts` section in an Ansible playbook?**
   The `hosts` section in an Ansible playbook specifies the target hosts or groups of hosts on which the playbook should be executed. You can define this section at the start of each play within the playbook. The hosts can refer to hostnames or groups of hosts defined in your inventory.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   - hosts: webservers
     tasks:
       - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
         ansible.builtin.yum:
           name: nginx
           state: present
   ```
   In this example, the play will be executed on all hosts in the `webservers` group as defined in the Ansible inventory.

---

### 21. **What is the purpose of the `become` keyword in Ansible?**
   The `become` keyword in Ansible is used to elevate user privileges, typically to root or another specified user, during the execution of tasks. It allows tasks to run with higher privileges if required, like installing packages or modifying system configurations.

   Example usage:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: Install a package
       become: yes
       apt:
         name: vim
         state: present
   ```

### 22. **What are Ansible tags, and how do they work?**
   Ansible tags are used to selectively run specific tasks or blocks within a playbook. Tags allow you to execute only certain parts of a playbook, instead of running the entire playbook. This is useful for debugging, testing, or when you want to apply changes to only specific parts of your infrastructure.

   Example usage:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: Install package A
       apt:
         name: package_A
       tags:
         - install
     - name: Install package B
       apt:
         name: package_B
       tags:
         - install
         - important
   ```

### 23. **How do you execute a specific part of a playbook in Ansible using tags?**
   To execute a specific part of a playbook using tags, you can use the `--tags` option when running the `ansible-playbook` command. This will only run tasks that are associated with the specified tags.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "install"
   ```

   This command will only run tasks that have the `install` tag.

### 24. **What is the purpose of the `when` statement in Ansible?**
   The `when` statement in Ansible is used to conditionally execute tasks, based on the evaluation of a given expression or variable. It allows tasks to be skipped or run depending on specific conditions.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: Install package A
       apt:
         name: package_A
         state: present
       when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
   ```

### 25. **How can you define default values for variables in Ansible?**
   Default values for variables in Ansible can be defined in various places, such as in playbooks, inventory files, or roles. The `default` filter can also be used within tasks to provide a fallback value for a variable if it is not set.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   vars:
     my_variable: "{{ my_variable | default('default_value') }}"
   ```

### 26. **What is the purpose of `loop` in Ansible?**
   The `loop` keyword in Ansible is used to iterate over a list or set of items, running a task for each item. It helps to avoid repetitive task definitions and makes the playbook more concise.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: Install multiple packages
       apt:
         name: "{{ item }}"
         state: present
       loop:
         - vim
         - git
         - curl
   ```

### 27. **What is the difference between `include` and `import` in Ansible?**
   The main difference between `include` and `import` in Ansible is in how the files are processed:
   - `include`: The file is included and executed at runtime. It allows conditional inclusion and is processed dynamically.
   - `import`: The file is imported and executed when the playbook is parsed. It is processed at the start of the playbook run and cannot be used conditionally.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   # include example
   - include: tasks/setup.yml

   # import example
   - import_tasks: tasks/setup.yml
   ```

### 28. **What are dynamic inventories in Ansible?**
   Dynamic inventories in Ansible refer to inventories that are generated at runtime, often by querying external sources (like cloud providers or APIs) instead of using static inventory files. This is useful for managing dynamic environments, where the list of hosts may change frequently.

   Example of using AWS dynamic inventory:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yml playbook.yml
   ```

   Where `aws_ec2.yml` is an inventory script that queries AWS EC2 instances.

### 29. **How do you execute Ansible playbooks on a single host or group of hosts?**
   To execute a playbook on a single host or group of hosts, use the `-l` (limit) option followed by the host or group name in the inventory file.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml -l web_servers
   ```

   This command will run the playbook only on the `web_servers` group defined in your inventory.

### 30. **What is Ansible Galaxy?**
   Ansible Galaxy is a community-driven hub for sharing Ansible roles, playbooks, and collections. It allows users to find, share, and reuse Ansible content, which helps reduce development time and maintain consistency across automation tasks.

   Example usage:
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
   ```

   This command installs the `geerlingguy.apache` role from Ansible Galaxy, which can then be used in your playbook.

---

### 31. **What is the purpose of `ansible-galaxy` command?**
   The `ansible-galaxy` command is used to interact with Ansible Galaxy, a repository for Ansible roles and collections. It allows you to install, create, share, and manage roles, and also manage Ansible collections. You can use it to download pre-built roles or to publish your own roles to the Galaxy platform.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
   ```

   This installs the `geerlingguy.apache` role from Ansible Galaxy.

### 32. **What is the difference between `user` and `group` modules in Ansible?**
   - **`user` module**: The `user` module is used to manage user accounts on the target hosts. You can create, modify, or delete users, set their passwords, and control their shell, groups, etc.
   - **`group` module**: The `group` module is used to manage groups on the target hosts. It allows you to create, modify, or delete groups and manage group memberships.

   Example:
   - `user` module:
     ```yaml
     - name: Create a user
       user:
         name: john
         state: present
     ```
   - `group` module:
     ```yaml
     - name: Create a group
       group:
         name: admin
         state: present
     ```

### 33. **How do you install a package using Ansible?**
   To install a package using Ansible, you can use the `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf` modules depending on the Linux distribution you're using. These modules manage packages and can install, update, or remove packages.

   Example using `apt`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install nginx
     apt:
       name: nginx
       state: present
   ```

   Example using `yum`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install nginx
     yum:
       name: nginx
       state: present
   ```

### 34. **What is the `command` module in Ansible?**
   The `command` module is used to run commands on the target host, similar to running commands directly in the shell. It does not process through a shell, so shell-specific features like piping (`|`) or redirection (`>`) are not available in `command`.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run a command
     command: /usr/bin/uptime
   ```

   If you need shell functionality, use the `shell` module instead.

### 35. **How does Ansible handle error handling?**
   Ansible handles errors with the `ignore_errors`, `failed_when`, and `block`/`rescue` structures:
   - `ignore_errors`: Allows the playbook to continue even if a task fails.
   - `failed_when`: Allows you to define custom conditions under which a task should be considered failed.
   - `block`/`rescue`: These provide a way to handle errors by grouping tasks and defining alternative actions if an error occurs.

   Example of `ignore_errors`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install a package that may fail
     apt:
       name: non-existent-package
       state: present
     ignore_errors: yes
   ```

   Example of `failed_when`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Check for a specific service
     service:
       name: nginx
       state: started
     failed_when: result.rc != 0
   ```

### 36. **What is an Ansible role?**
   An Ansible role is a way to organize and reuse automation tasks, variables, files, templates, and handlers in a structured manner. Roles are used to define reusable components that can be applied across different playbooks, making it easier to manage complex automation tasks.

   A role can contain:
   - `tasks`: Tasks to execute on the target machines
   - `handlers`: Handlers for specific tasks
   - `vars`: Variables used by the role
   - `defaults`: Default values for variables
   - `files`: Files to copy to the target machines
   - `templates`: Jinja2 templates for configuration files

### 37. **How do you define a role in Ansible?**
   A role is typically defined in a specific directory structure within your project:
   ```
   roles/
     └── myrole/
         ├── tasks/
         │   └── main.yml
         ├── handlers/
         │   └── main.yml
         ├── vars/
         │   └── main.yml
         ├── defaults/
         │   └── main.yml
         ├── files/
         ├── templates/
   ```

   In your playbook, you reference the role like this:
   ```yaml
   - hosts: all
     roles:
       - myrole
   ```

### 38. **What are `vars_files` and `vars` in Ansible playbooks?**
   - **`vars_files`**: This is used to include external YAML files containing variables. It is useful for organizing variables outside the playbook.
     Example:
     ```yaml
     vars_files:
       - vars.yml
     ```
   - **`vars`**: This is used to define variables directly within the playbook.
     Example:
     ```yaml
     vars:
       package_name: nginx
     ```

### 39. **How do you include a file in an Ansible playbook?**
   In Ansible, you can include files (e.g., task files, variable files) in a playbook using the `include` or `import` statements. The `include` statement is typically used for including tasks or other playbooks dynamically, while `import` is used when you want the file to be processed at playbook load time.

   Example of including a tasks file:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - include: tasks/setup.yml
   ```

   Example of including a variable file:
   ```yaml
   vars_files:
     - vars.yml
   ```

### 40. **What is the purpose of `notify` in Ansible handlers?**
   The `notify` directive in Ansible is used to trigger handlers when certain tasks are changed. Handlers are special tasks that are only run when notified by other tasks (typically after a change). This allows for actions like restarting a service after a configuration change.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: Install nginx
       apt:
         name: nginx
         state: present
       notify:
         - Restart nginx

   handlers:
     - name: Restart nginx
       service:
         name: nginx
         state: restarted
   ```

   In this example, the `Restart nginx` handler is triggered only if the `nginx` package is installed or changed.

---

### 41. **How do you set up SSH keys for Ansible?**
   Ansible requires SSH access to manage remote hosts. To set up SSH keys:
   1. Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine using the following command:
      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
      ```
   2. Copy the public key to the remote host:
      ```bash
      ssh-copy-id user@remote_host
      ```
   3. Ensure that the remote host allows key-based authentication by checking the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the remote system.
   4. After setting up SSH keys, Ansible will use SSH to communicate with remote systems without needing a password.

### 42. **What are `facts` in Ansible, and how are they collected?**
   Facts in Ansible are system information about the target hosts, like operating system, network interfaces, IP addresses, and memory. These are collected automatically by Ansible before executing tasks on the target machine.
   
   Facts are gathered using the `setup` module, which runs automatically at the start of each playbook unless disabled.
   To disable fact gathering:
   ```yaml
   - hosts: all
     gather_facts: no
   ```
   To explicitly gather facts:
   ```yaml
   - name: Gather system facts
     setup:
   ```

### 43. **What is the `ansible_facts` module?**
   The `ansible_facts` module is used to explicitly collect and return a set of facts about a remote system. It's similar to the `setup` module, which collects information about a target host's configuration, such as OS type, architecture, and IP addresses. You can also use `ansible_facts` to gather specific pieces of information, depending on your needs.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Gather specific facts
     ansible.builtin.setup:
       gather_subset:
         - network
   ```

### 44. **What is the difference between `copy` and `template` modules in Ansible?**
   - **`copy` module**: The `copy` module is used to copy files from the local machine to the target host. It is mainly used for static files, as it does not process the contents of the file before copying.
     Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Copy a file to the remote host
       copy:
         src: /path/to/local/file.txt
         dest: /path/to/remote/file.txt
     ```
   - **`template` module**: The `template` module is used to copy a file and process it as a Jinja2 template. This allows you to insert variables or conditionals into the file before copying it to the target system.
     Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Template a configuration file
       template:
         src: /path/to/template.conf.j2
         dest: /path/to/remote/config.conf
     ```

### 45. **How do you manage configuration files with Ansible?**
   Ansible can manage configuration files by:
   - Using the `copy` module to copy static configuration files to remote hosts.
   - Using the `template` module to dynamically generate configuration files from templates with Jinja2.
   - Using the `lineinfile` module to ensure a particular line exists or is absent in a file.
   - Using the `blockinfile` module to insert a block of text into a file.

   Example of using `template` to manage a configuration file:
   ```yaml
   - name: Copy the template file
     template:
       src: /templates/config.j2
       dest: /etc/myapp/config.conf
   ```

### 46. **What is Ansible’s idempotency feature?**
   Idempotency in Ansible means that running the same playbook or task multiple times will not cause unintended side effects. The state of the system will only change if it differs from the desired state. If a task has already achieved the desired state, it will be skipped in subsequent runs.
   
   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install nginx
     apt:
       name: nginx
       state: present
   ```
   If `nginx` is already installed, Ansible will not install it again, ensuring idempotency.

### 47. **How can you use Ansible to restart a service?**
   You can use the `service` module to restart a service in Ansible. This module can start, stop, restart, or reload services.
   
   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Restart nginx service
     service:
       name: nginx
       state: restarted

### 48. **What is the purpose of `lineinfile` module in Ansible?**
   The `lineinfile` module ensures that a specific line is present or absent in a file. It can be used to add, modify, or remove a line in a file. It is useful for managing configuration files or adding specific content without overwriting the entire file.
   
   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Ensure a line is present in a file
     lineinfile:
       path: /etc/myconfig.conf
       line: 'option=value'
   ```

### 49. **How can you check whether a file exists on a remote host using Ansible?**
   You can use the `stat` module to check whether a file exists on a remote host. It returns information about the file, such as whether it exists and its attributes.
   
   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Check if file exists
     stat:
       path: /path/to/remote/file.txt
     register: file_status

   - name: Fail if file does not exist
     fail:
       msg: "The file does not exist!"
     when: file_status.stat.exists == false
   ```

### 50. **What is the `shell` module in Ansible?**
   The `shell` module is used to execute commands on the remote host through the shell. Unlike the `command` module, it allows you to run shell-specific commands like piping (`|`), redirection (`>`), and environment variable usage.
   
   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run a shell command
     shell: "echo $HOME"
   ```
